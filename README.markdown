###What is it?###

The LogBook project aims to ease the development process for Flex applications by allowing Flex and pure ActionScript logging messages to be sent to the AIR application via LocalConnections.

To see how to use Logbook with pure AS3 projects, see the entry [here]("http://teamcim.comcast.net/team/flash/2008/04/logbook_now_for_pure_actionscr.html","Using Logbook with AS3 projects").

If you have a feature you would wish to add to the project, talk about it on the [Google Group]("http://groups.google.com/group/cimlogbook") and add it to the issues section here.
